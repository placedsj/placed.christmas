DIY Disasters

### The Great Toilet Paper Holder Catastrophe

What started as a simple 5-minute install turned into a 3-hour adventure involving two trips to the hardware store...


Jan 15, 20255 min read

Picture this: It's Sunday afternoon, you're feeling handy, and you decide to install that new toilet paper holder you bought three months ago. "This'll take 5 minutes," you tell yourself. Famous last words.


First, you realize you need a level. Then you discover your drill bit is too small. Off to Home Depot. Back home, you start drilling and hit a water pipe. Panic sets in. You call Sherwood's Mobile Mechanics (yes, they do emergency plumbing too), and three hours later, you have both a new toilet paper holder AND a story for the ages.


**Lesson learned:** Sometimes the best DIY decision is knowing when to call a professional. And always, ALWAYS check what's behind the wall before drilling.


#### Pro Tip from PlACED Partners:

Use a stud finder with pipe detection, or better yet, call one of our trusted contractors for installations involving plumbing or electrical work.

Contractor Chronicles

### Paul's Roofing: Above and Beyond

When Hurricane Larry left half of Moncton without proper roofing, Paul's team worked around the clock...


Jan 12, 20257 min read

Hurricane Larry wasn't just another storm - it was a wake-up call for homeowners across Atlantic Canada. When the winds died down and the rain stopped, Paul's Roofing received over 200 emergency calls in 48 hours.


Instead of cherry-picking the easy jobs, Paul's team created a priority system: families with young children and elderly residents first, then systematic neighborhood-by-neighborhood coverage. They brought in crews from other provinces and worked 16-hour days for two weeks straight.


The Johnsons from Riverview still talk about how Paul himself climbed onto their damaged roof at 11 PM during a drizzle because their baby's nursery was getting soaked. "He didn't just fix our roof," Mrs. Johnson says, "he restored our faith in contractors."


#### Why We Partner with Paul's:

It's not just about technical skill - it's about character. Paul's Roofing proves that the best contractors don't just fix problems, they care about people.

Maintenance Magic

### The Atlantic Canadian Winter Prep Checklist

Don't let winter catch you off guard. Here's the comprehensive checklist that could save you thousands...


Jan 10, 202510 min read

Read More

Atlantic Canadian winters don't mess around. From Halifax's coastal storms to Fredericton's deep freezes, your home faces unique challenges that require specific preparation.


#### The Essential Checklist:

- **Furnace Service:** Schedule now, not when it's -20°C
- **Window Caulking:** Check every seal - heat loss = money loss
- **Roof Inspection:** Ice dams are real and expensive
- **Pipe Insulation:** Burst pipes can cause $10,000+ in damage
- **Gutter Cleaning:** Ice blockages can destroy gutters
- **Chimney Check:** Carbon monoxide is a silent killer

#### PlACED Maintenance (Coming Soon!):

We're launching a comprehensive maintenance service that handles your entire winter prep checklist. Sign up for early access!

Seasonal Care

### Christmas Lights: Your Safety vs. Your Sanity

Every December, emergency rooms see a spike in ladder-related injuries. Here's why PlACED Christmas exists...


Jan 8, 20256 min read

Read More

Every year, the same story repeats across Atlantic Canada. November hits, Christmas music starts playing, and suddenly everyone becomes a lighting expert. Spoiler alert: ladders and icy conditions don't mix well with holiday spirit.


Last year alone, the QE II Hospital treated 47 people for ladder-related injuries between November and January. Most were putting up or taking down Christmas lights. The average cost? $2,800 in medical bills, plus weeks of recovery time.


That's exactly why we created PlACED Christmas. "Your Christmas, Our Hands" isn't just a catchy slogan - it's a promise that you can have the most beautiful light display on your street without risking your neck (literally).


#### The PlACED Christmas Difference:

- Professional installation with commercial-grade equipment
- Custom design consultation
- Complete takedown and storage service
- Fully insured and bonded

### When Your Car Dies in Your Own Driveway

Nothing says "homeowner life" like having a dead car as lawn decoration. Enter Sherwood's Mobile Mechanics...


Jan 5, 20254 min read

Read More

There's a special kind of embarrassment that comes with owning a home and having your car die in your own driveway. It's like your house is judging you. "Really, Karen? You can maintain a mortgage but not an oil change schedule?"


This happened to me last month. My 2018 Honda decided that -15°C was the perfect time to give up on life, right there in my driveway. My neighbors started walking by slower, probably wondering if I was starting a junkyard collection.


That's when I discovered Sherwood's Mobile Mechanics. They came right to my driveway, diagnosed the problem (dead battery - how original), and had me running in 20 minutes. No tow truck, no awkward conversations with neighbors, no driving to a shop.


#### The Sherwood's Advantage:

They fix your car where it breaks down - whether that's your driveway, the grocery store parking lot, or that sketchy rest stop on the highway to Halifax.

DIY Disasters

### The Kitchen Faucet Incident of 2024

A simple faucet replacement turned into a weekend-long saga involving three different hardware stores...


Jan 3, 20258 min read

Read More

It started innocently enough. My kitchen faucet had been dripping for months, and YouTube made it look so easy. "20-minute job," the guy in the video said confidently. Three days later, I had no water, a flooded kitchen, and a very patient wife questioning my life choices.


The first problem: my sink was installed by someone who apparently believed that standard measurements were merely suggestions. The second problem: whoever installed the original faucet used some kind of industrial-strength adhesive that required archaeological tools to remove.


By Sunday evening, I had visited Canadian Tire, Home Depot, AND Kent three times each, bought $200 worth of tools I didn't need, and created a small indoor lake in my kitchen. That's when my neighbor recommended PlACED's network of trusted contractors.


#### When to Call the Pros:

If the YouTube video makes it look easy, and you've never done it before, it's probably not as easy as it looks. Save yourself the weekend and call a PlACED partner.
